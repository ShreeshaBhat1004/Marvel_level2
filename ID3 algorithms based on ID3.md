# Decision tree based ID3 Algorithm
**Decision tree** algorithm is a branch of Machine learning, it is a recursive algorithm which traverses a dataset by keeping a root node and moving onto its branches or child nodes by only considering non-traversed nodes.We can perform regression(numerical prediction) tasks as well as Classification(yes or no prediction) tasks using Decision trees. 
**Why the algorithm is called *decision tree*?**
An analogy between a tree and a decision tree can help illustrate the concept of a decision tree. In a decision tree, you have a root node (analogous to the tree's trunk) that represents the initial decision point. From the root node, there are branches (analogous to the tree's branches) that lead to different decisions or choices. These branches are split based on specific conditions or features related to the data. As you move down the tree, you encounter more nodes and branches, much like the tree's branches and leaves. Ultimately, you reach the leaf nodes (analogous to the tree's leaves), which represent the final outcomes or decisions.
